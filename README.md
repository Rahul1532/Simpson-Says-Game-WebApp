### Simpson Says Game - Frontend Implementation

#### Description
The "Simpson Says" game is a fun and interactive memory game inspired by the classic "Simon Says" game, but with a twist featuring characters from the beloved TV show, The Simpsons. The goal of the game is to mimic a sequence of actions demonstrated by the game. As the player progresses, the sequences get longer and more challenging, testing the player's memory and attention.

#### Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players are required to repeat a sequence of highlighted buttons, which represent actions.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: With each correct sequence, the game adds another action to the sequence, making it progressively more difficult.
- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive user interface that makes the game easy to play for users of all ages.

#### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the game.
- **CSS**: For styling the game elements, providing a visually appealing experience.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic, including generating random sequences, capturing user input, and checking correctness.

#### How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Click on the "Start" button to begin.
2. **Watch the Sequence**: Pay attention to the sequence of highlighted buttons.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click on the buttons in the same order as shown.
4. **Progress**: If you get the sequence correct, a new step will be added to the sequence. If you make a mistake, the game will reset, and you can try again.
